# Miner Monitor

Monitors the temperature of your GPU to restart the miner in case something went wrong. When the miner stops working for whatever reasong (bug on the miner, overclock issue, network issues) the temperature drops so this monito will kill the old proces and restart a new one.

Based on OpenHardwareMonitor(https://github.com/openhardwaremonitor/openhardwaremonitor).
